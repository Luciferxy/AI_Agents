# Email AI Agent

The Email AI Agent is an AI-powered tool designed to automate email handling, leveraging [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) for multi-agent workflows, [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) for language model integration, and [Groq](https://groq.com/) for fast inference. This README provides a comprehensive guide to set up, use, and contribute to the project.

## Features

- **Email Classification**: Categorizes emails (e.g., urgent, spam, personal) for better organization.
- **Smart Drafting**: Generates context-aware email replies with adjustable tone.
- **Task Automation**: Extracts action items or tasks from emails for efficient management.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define agent roles and tasks via CrewAI's multi-agent framework.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Powered by LangChain and Groq for robust text processing and rapid responses.

## Tech Stack

- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent orchestration for collaborative AI workflows.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with large language models.
- **Groq**: High-performance inference for fast language model processing.
- **Python**: Core programming language for development.
